## Features

- Write trading orders on the Solana blockchain
- Track leverage (& margin) adjustments for trading positions
- Increased transparency through independent verification of orders and profit claims

Our trades are written onto the Solana blockchain and can be verified by anyone using a blockchain explorer. Here's how you can track and verify the trades made by the Hb Capital Smart Contract:

1. Visit a Solana blockchain explorer. Some options include [Solscan](https://solscan.io/), [Solana Beach](https://solanabeach.io/), or [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/).
2. In the search bar, enter the address of our deployed smart contract: `INSERT_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE`.
3. This will bring up a page with details about the smart contract, including a list of transactions.
4. Click on a transaction to view its details. This includes the input and output addresses, the amount of the transaction, and the timestamp.
5. Use these details to track and verify the trades made by the Hb Capital Smart Contract.
